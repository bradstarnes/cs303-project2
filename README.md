• Morse code (see the table below) is a common code that is used to encode messages consisting
of letters and digits. Each letter consists of a series of dots and dashes, for example, the code for
the letter a is - and the code for the letter b is -. Store each letter of the alphabet in a node
of a binary tree of depth 4. The root node is at depth 0 and stores no letter. The left node at
depth 1 stores the letter e (code ) and the right node stores the letter t (code is -). The four
nodes at depth 2 stores the letters with codes (,-, -, --). To build the tree (See the figure
below), read a file in which each line consists of a letter followed by its code. The letters should
be ordered by tree depth. To find the position for a letter in the tree, scan the code and branch
left for a dot and branch right for a dash. Encode a message by replacing each letter by its code
symbol. Then decode the message using Morse code tree. Make sure you use a delimiter symbol
between coded letters. 


Technical Requirements
• (Weight: 40%) Write a function that builds the morse tree shown in the figure above. The
information of the tree (the letters and the codes) is stored in a file. You can find the file here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/3cj8yb8gcdsrefg/morse.txt?dl=0 (Notice that the file hasn’t been
laid out in convenient order for building the tree).
• (Weight: 30%) Your system should be able to decode a message using the morse tree that you
built. For example, decoding - -- results in “dg”. The problem text briefly explains how you
can do that. Notice that between the symbols (dots and dashes) is a space. The space is a
delimiter that separates the codes for letters.
• (Weight: 30%) Your system should also encode a message. For example, encoding “ac” results in
- --.
• You may use a binary search tree or a map to store the codes for letters.
Facts and Assumptions
• You may assume that the character delimiters are simply spaces.
• You may assume the string has one word only.
• You are welcome to use the source code on Blackboard (e.g. Binary_Tree,
Binary_Search_Tree).
• You may just call the decode and encode functions in the main function. There is no need for
getting input from the user or a menu-based system.
